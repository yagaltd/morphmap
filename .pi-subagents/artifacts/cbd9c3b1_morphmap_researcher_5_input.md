# Task for morphmap/researcher

[Read from: /home/aurel/Documents/current/Morph/MorphMap/docs/mech-mindmap.md]

Apply 5-Why to SECTION 7 (Implementation) of /home/aurel/Documents/current/Morph/MorphMap/docs/mech-mindmap.md

Drill into:
1. 6 phases (A→F) — why strictly sequential? Why not parallel phases?
2. Phase priorities (Now/Soon/Later) — why D is Soon not Now? Why F is Later?
3. ~1750 LOC estimate — why this number? What's the confidence interval?
4. Pure module ~900 lines — why does pure/impure ratio matter? What if pure is larger?
5. File structure — why mech/ as subdirectory? Why not separate package?

For each: 5-Why chain, verdict, hidden assumptions.
Write to /tmp/mech-5why-section7.md

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
