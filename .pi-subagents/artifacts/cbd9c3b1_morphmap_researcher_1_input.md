# Task for morphmap/researcher

[Read from: /home/aurel/Documents/current/Morph/MorphMap/docs/mech-mindmap.md]

Apply 5-Why to SECTION 3 (Fractal Loop) of /home/aurel/Documents/current/Morph/MorphMap/docs/mech-mindmap.md

Drill into:
1. Same pattern at every depth — why fractal? Why not flat hierarchy?
2. Orchestrator = branch-agent — why merge roles? Why not keep separate?
3. Context isolation per sub-branch-agent — why fresh context? Why not shared?
4. Branch size rules (>5, >10, >300 lines) — why these numbers? Why not dynamic?
5. Inter-branch dependencies — why two types (needs/needs-contract)? Why not one?

For each: 5-Why chain, verdict, hidden assumptions.
Write to /tmp/mech-5why-section3.md

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
